###General
Microsoft Entra ID provides several ways to manage access to resources, applications, and tasks. With Microsoft Entra groups, you can grant access and permissions to a group of users instead of for each individual user. Limiting access to Microsoft Entra resources to only those users who need access is one of the core security principles of Zero Trust.
