# Modern Workspace
Combining Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 creates a powerful modern workspace. Azure provides cloud services like Virtual Machines, Azure AD, and Azure DevOps, while Microsoft 365 includes productivity tools like Office apps, Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint. Together, they enhance security with features like Multi-Factor Authentication and Conditional Access. They also enable seamless collaboration through Teams and SharePoint, and offer scalability and flexibility with Azureâ€™s cloud infrastructure. Automation tools like Azure DevOps and Power Automate improve efficiency. Comprehensive management and security are ensured with Intune and Azure Security Center. This combination supports remote work, collaboration, and innovation effectively.
