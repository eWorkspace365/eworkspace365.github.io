# Modern Digital Workspace
Combining Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 creates a powerful modern workspace. Azure provides cloud services like Virtual Machines, Azure AD, and Azure DevOps, while Microsoft 365 includes productivity tools like Office apps, Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint. Together, they enhance security with features like Multi-Factor Authentication and Conditional Access. They also enable seamless collaboration through Teams and SharePoint, and offer scalability and flexibility with Azure’s cloud infrastructure. Automation tools like Azure DevOps and Power Automate improve efficiency. Comprehensive management and security are ensured with Intune and Azure Security Center. This combination supports remote work, collaboration, and innovation effectively.

## Cloud Strategy

### Onboarding
ICT service providers can only exist if they deliver value to the customer

As a tactical and strategic process, Portfolio Management aims to achieve the maximum result with the portfolio of IT services.

The responsibility includes developing and managing a portfolio of services. Not by performing the development or management of the IT services themselves, but by ensuring that supply and demand for IT services are perfectly aligned at the time of delivery.

The objective is to achieve maximum results across all services by making visible what is being delivered and identifying areas for improvement.

This can be achieved by continuously assessing whether things can be done smarter or simpler, or whether more can be achieved with less, while ensuring the right speed and flexibility. Naturally, this must also be carried out at the lowest possible cost and in compliance with the organization’s rules (Security and Compliance).
